   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>

       <li>
	    Mash garlic into a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef's knife on your cutting board. 
       </li>
      

       <li>
	    Mix garlic into lamb with onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne pepper, ginger, and pepper in a mixing bowl until well blended.
       </li>
      

       <li>
	    Form mixture into 28 balls. Form each ball around the tip of a skewer, flattening it into a 2-inch oval; repeat with remaining skewers. Place kebabs onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.
       </li>
      

       <li>
	    Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
       </li>
      

       <li>
	    Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
       </li>
      

       <li>
	    Serve hot and enjoy!
       </li>
   </ol>
